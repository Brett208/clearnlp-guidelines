# Semantic Role Labeler
Our semantic role labeler uses a higher-order argument pruning algorithm that significantly improves recall from the first-order argument pruning algorithm, yet keeps a similar labeling complexity in practice. Our labeler takes about 0.45 milliseconds for labeling all arguments of each predicate on an Intel Xeon 2.57GHz machine and shows state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other dependency-based labeling approaches. See [how to run command-line tools](../quick_start/command_line_tools.md) for more details about decoding.
